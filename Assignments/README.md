This project is a non-functional website landing designed as a project for a Computer Science course at Marist College. The project was used as a way to get familiar with both HTML and CSS for designing webpages, but without adding functionality yet with JavaScript

For this project, I recreated a forum landing for the fictional company Aperture Laboratories of the Portal universe, owned by Valve Corporation.
