    "## Looking at the CSS Box Model\n",
    "In CSS there is this concept of a box model and it's important to understand. Based on the conversation that we had last class when we talked about Bootstrap, being able to understand what your code is gonna look like while writing it is extremely important especially for something so visually based!\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said we should talk about and play around with the concept of the box model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the model we have 4 things that we need to worry about. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Content, Padding, Border, and Margin**\n",
    "\n",
    "![Box Model](https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Update%20css%20margin%20vs%20padding-2.png?width=650&name=Update%20css%20margin%20vs%20padding-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at each of these pieces individually hopefully we can come to understand what they all do and are responsible for.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's look at the content, this is probably the easiest to interpret. The content is the tag directly. Whichever tag that you're using or styling for is your content. Whenever you move this object everything else moves (Padding, Margin, and Border). Outside of this our content is mostly controlled from the HTML side and we don't do much else from the CSS side (at a basic level at least). Content usually has a height and a width associated with it. This way we can have a way of altering the size of our content! Our height and width can be altered in many ways. For now we'll stick to percentage and pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next up we can talk about the padding this is similar to having shoulder pads in a suit or on a football player where it make the content look bigger. We're adding fluff to the size of the content. Padding is transparent and doesn't actually show, you just can kinda determine it's there because by default there is none.\n",
    "\n",
    "After padding comes the border you can think of borders very literally like how they would appear on a map. The border adds a line around your content AND your padding. This is important to note because when you may need some extra space in between your content and your border you can do so through the padding, not by attempting to move the border around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally and probably my favorite and most used is margin. Margin is pretty much your bubble. It's your personal space. It's what we use to social distance. Margin is what you use to say I don't care what's near me I need this amount of space between us. Margin is also transparent. In the context of determining if it's actually there or not it's a little more difficult to do if there's no border which leads us to out next topic!\n"
