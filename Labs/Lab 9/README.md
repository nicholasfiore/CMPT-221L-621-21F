We talked about the steps that we could possibly take to deploy a website. I want you to think about the combination of those things that you would consider if you had to deploy your website. This is a good thinking exercise to do because you gain insight to what all of the different steps entail and are responsible for. Write out what parts you would use below and describe why. It doesn't have to be the most detailed but personally what would you want to do? (I'm not looking for perfect but it should be a working configuration. Assuming all of the website code is done. I don't need to hear about that unless its for the certificate or web server).

If I could, I first of all would like to host the site myself. Using myself as a host gives me the most control over my website, and allows me to use it for nearly anything I might want. While it is more difficult due to also needing to be responsible for preventing attacks and similar situations, it definitely gives me the freedom I'd want for a site. If I were to use a hosting service, though, I'd likely use one of the ones like Heroku that have free tiers, and definitely would use docker to containerize the site for it. Lastly if I were to get a web certificate, I'd probably try and go the free route to minimize costs and such, if I can. Of course for my domain name I'd simply try and find the lowest cost from whatever website is selling them.
